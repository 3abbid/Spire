- deal better with failed installs
  - should SpireRemover be run on install failure?
  - should SpireRemover ignore errors, and just try and remove whatever it can, even after a failure?
- (probably) requires release of new mobilesubstrate to load into assistantd
  - alternately, insert ourselves in
- could WinterBoard overrides of capability files mess us up?
- finish control file: dependencies, description, support (who?), etc
- testing!
